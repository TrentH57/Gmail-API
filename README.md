# Gmail-API
This is just some practice with using the gmail api. 
I wanted to automatically download any pictures my wife would send me over emails so I could navigate them easier. 
This started with just the google api python quickstart.


This could be used in lots of ways. Once the files are downloaded, or even without downloading them, they could be sent to some ML model to detect certain types of files(letters of approval)

There are secret keys and data that each user would have to generate to use on their own system.
